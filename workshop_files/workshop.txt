description=[h1]Quick guide[/h1]

description=[h2]Amputation[/h2]

description=Get a [i]Saw[/i] or a [i]Garden Saw[/i], right click on it, and choose which limb to amputate. You can also drag n' drop your Saw item directly into the afflicted area to start cutting it off.

description=

description=If you have some [i]bandages[/i] and\or [i]stitches[/i] in your inventory you will automatically use them, multiplying the chances of your survival.

description=If you have a [i]tourniquet[/i], place it on the correct side to dampen the amount of damage you will take after you're done amputating the limb.

description=

description=Keep in mind that if you amputate your [b]upper arm[/b], you won't be able to equip any prosthesis.

description=

description=After you've amputated a limb, you will gain [b]skill points[/b] for the amputated side, making timed actions faster in due time.

description=

description=[h2]Cicatrization[/h2]

description=You can check the cicatrization status of an amputated limb from your [b]Health Panel[/b]

description=From time to time, you should clean your wounds with a bandage to help the cicatrization process.

description=If your limb isn't completely cicatrized, you can still equip prosthetic limbs, but that can trigger random bleedings from that area.

description=

description=[h2]Prosthetics[/h2]

description=If you're missing a hand, you won't be able to do a lot of things, such as equipping two-handed weapons. With prosthetics limbs, you can fix that.

description=There are two prosthesis type that can be crafted\found in medical areas:

description=[list]

description=[*] Hook Prosthesis

description=[*] Arm Prosthesis

description=[/list]

description=

description=The main difference between the twos is that your actions will take longer with the Hook Prosthesis.

description=When you equip a prosthetic limb, you will slowly gain skill points in the [b]Prosthesis Familiarity[/b] perk, making actions more speedy in due time.

description=

description=[h2]Admin tools[/h2]

description=If something strange happened, an admin can reset TOC mechanics on any player by right clicking on them and select [i]"Reset Amputations"[/i]. They could also do the opposite by clicking on [i]"Force Amputation"[/i] for each amputable limb.
